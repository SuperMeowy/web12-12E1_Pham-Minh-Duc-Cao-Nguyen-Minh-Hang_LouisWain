                    <p class="subtitle">Delving into the vibrant and often unsettling abstract works from his later years, and the theories behind them.</p>

                    <p>While Louis Wain is fondly remembered for his charming, anthropomorphic cats, a more enigmatic and controversial phase of his artistic career emerged during his later years. As his mental health deteriorated, Wain's art underwent a dramatic transformation, leading to a series of vivid, fragmented, and often unsettling images that have been dubbed his "psychedelic" period.</p>

                    <h2>The Shift: From Whimsy to Abstraction</h2>
                    <p>The transition from Wain's early, playful cat portraits to his later abstract works is stark. His familiar feline forms began to dissolve into intricate patterns, vibrant colours, and almost fractal-like repetitions. The cats retained their large, expressive eyes but were increasingly surrounded by, or composed of, swirling lines and geometric shapes, reflecting a profound shift in his perception.</p>

                    <p>These later works are often presented as visual evidence of his deteriorating mental state, specifically schizophrenia, a theory popularized by psychiatrist Walter Maclay in the 1930s. Maclay arranged a series of Wain's paintings to demonstrate a progressive disintegration of artistic style mirroring the supposed progression of the illness.</p>

                    <h3>Debate and Reinterpretation</h3>
                    <p>However, modern art historians and mental health experts largely dispute Maclay's simplistic interpretation. They argue that artistic style does not necessarily correlate directly with mental illness progression and that Wain's stylistic evolution could also be seen as an intentional exploration of abstraction and pattern, influenced by various contemporary art movements.</p>

                    <blockquote>"Wain's later works, far from being mere symptoms of madness, represent a bold, if perhaps unintentional, foray into modernist abstraction, challenging conventional notions of sanity and artistic expression." — Art Critic</blockquote>

                    <p>Regardless of the underlying cause, Wain's psychedelic cats offer a captivating glimpse into the mind of an artist pushing the boundaries of visual representation. They stand as powerful, often haunting, testament to his enduring creativity even amidst personal turmoil, and continue to spark fascination and discussion among art enthusiasts and scholars alike.</p>
